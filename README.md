# CoreDataCloudKitSync
***
## Meetup Presentation for Swift Miami Meetup. 
* The code for this repository is on the Swift Miami GitHub : git@github.com:swift-miami/NSPersistentCloudKitContainer.git
* This Meetup presentation was to present Apple's new NSPersistentCloudKitContainer and syncing data between Core Data and CloudKit. I had experience using Core Data/CloudKit prior to this new framework and after converting a project to use the NSPersistentCloudKitContainer and seeing how easy it was, I was asked to present to the group.
